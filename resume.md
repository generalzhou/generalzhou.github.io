##Summary
I am a web developer and recent graduate from Dev Bootcamp.  I'm looking for a position that will allow me to contribute well written code, and challenge me to keep learning. I know Ruby, Rails, JavaScript/jQuery, ActiveRecord, HTML5, CSS, SQLite3, and git.

##Education

###Dev Bootcamp
__Class of 2013__

Dev Bootcamp is a 9 week program where I spent 12 hours a day learning to become a web developer. In addition to learning the technologies listed above, I:

* Pair programmed for 8+ hours a day
* Worked on 8 different group projects including a final project that spanned 1.5 weeks
* Collaborated using git and Github
* Performed and received code reviews

Here are some projects I worked on at Dev Bootcamp that I am particularly proud of: 

* __Movie recommender:__ This app uses a Pearson correlation algorithm to predict movies you might like.  I used movie data from [GroupLens Research](www.grouplens.org)  

	Source code here: <https://github.com/generalzhou/movie_recommender>
* __StrobeHub:__ I worked on a four person team to build a Github for music. I chose to work on this because I was excited about the challenge of building a music editor in JavaScript, a language I had little exposure to. I coded most of the music editor front end, learning object oriented JavaScript and the HTML5 Web Audio API along the way.
