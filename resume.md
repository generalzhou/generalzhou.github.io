##Experience

###Funding Circle US

__Senior Engineer, Technical Lead__  
*July 2015 - Present*  
Led the borrower applications team consisting of 3-4 full-stack and front-end developers. Our team's responsibilities include the borrower loan application and several apps that handled data integrations.

Some of my team's accomplishments:

- Launched the new borrower loan application under tight deadlines. This application receives most of our borrower traffic, and we were able to launch it without hiccups for both new and existing borrowers. See this app here: https://www.fundingcircle.com/us/apply
- Integrate with a 3rd party bank information provider, allowing borrowers to automatically connect to their bank accounts instead of sending us several bank account statements. This also greatly automated what used to be a manual data entry process.
- Integrate with Salesforce, pushing multiple stages of the loan application to allow for pipeline data analysis.
- Built a fraud integration with Sphonic to automate our fraud detection process.
- Automate Experian business report pulls. This new data allowed us to use a new, more predictive risk model.



Temporarily took over as technical lead on the investor team:  

- Used Consul to perform leader election to ensure that only one server ran cron jobs. This allowed us to safely scale up our servers without having duplicate workers.  
- Built tools to allow our loan servicing team to manually modify loan schedules and reverse charged back repayments.

__Software Engineer__  
*April 2014 â€“ Present*  
As an early engineer, I got to work on nearly all aspects of our technology stack. Some projects:    

- Launched first version of our investor API, built in Ruby.  
- Launched second version of our investor API, built in Clojure.  
- Built a connector to our bank. This enabled investors to initiate deposits and withdrawals from our platform, and for us to automatically track these money movements.  
- Built and launched our underwriter tool, helping our credit team move off of Excel and enabling better data collection. The app consisted of an API backend in Ruby and a single page frontend app in Angular.  
- Created a Docker based build and deployment process.  
- Worked on a centralized logging system using the ELK stack.  
- Interviewed dozens of engineering candidates in phone screens, code reviews, and pair programming challenges.      I've helped increase headcount from 4 to 20 engineers.  

###Groupon  
__Software Engineer - Application Operations__  
*August 2013 to April 2014*  
- Wrote both frontend Javascript and backend Rails, with full unit and integration test coverage.  
- Optimized queries to improve load times from 30 seconds to 200ms on an internal app.
