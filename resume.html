<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I am a web developer and recent graduate from Dev Bootcamp.  I'm looking for a position that will allow me to contribute well written code while challenging me to keep learning. I have experience with Ruby, Rails, JavaScript/jQuery, HTML5, CSS, Rspec/Capybara, SQLite3, and git/Github.</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<h3>Dev Bootcamp</h3>
<p><strong>Class of 2013</strong></p>
<p>Dev Bootcamp is a 9 week program where I spent 12 hours a day learning to become a web developer. In addition to learning the technologies listed above, I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pair programmed for 8+ hours a day</li>
<li>Worked on 8 different group projects including a final project that spanned 1.5 weeks</li>
<li>Collaborated using git and Github</li>
<li>Performed and received code reviews</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some projects I worked on at Dev Bootcamp that I am particularly proud of: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Movie recommender:</strong> This app uses a Pearson correlation algorithm to predict movies you might like.  I used movie data from <a href="www.grouplens.org">GroupLens Research</a>  
</p>
<p>Source code here: <a href="https://github.com/generalzhou/movie_recommender">https://github.com/generalzhou/movie_recommender</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>StrobeHub:</strong> I worked on a four person team to build a Github for music. I chose to work on this because I was excited about the challenge of building a music editor in JavaScript, a language I had little exposure to. I coded most of the music editor front end, learning object oriented JavaScript and the HTML5 Web Audio API along the way.</p>
