Hello,

I am a recent Dev Bootcamp (DBC) graduate with experience building database backed, full stack applications. I am very interested in machine learning and big data, and I would love to be your new data engineer.

I became interested in big data when I worked with a machine learning consultant at a previous job. He inspired me to learn Ruby, which I used to scrape websites to generate training sets for his algorithms.  I learned web development at Dev Bootcamp. I worked on many group projects at DBC, and I think that your engineering team will find me easy to work with. I built many, many applications at DBC, but when I had a free moment I built a movie recommendation app

Movie recommender - uses an algorithm based on Pearson correlation to recommend movies you might like. https://github.com/generalzhou/movie_recommender

StrobeHub - Github for music. I built most of the music editor in JavaScript, a language I previously had little experience in.  https://github.com/allareri/strobehub

I am still a relative beginner and very eager to learn. The mentorship offered by the engineers at Indiegogo really interest me, as well as the introduction to big data.

I will be able to contribute from the beginning, and I will be able to contribute so much more after a few months and years under guidance from your engineering team.  

Jack
