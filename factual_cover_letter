Hello,

I am a recent Dev Bootcamp (DBC) graduate with experience building database backed, full stack applications. I am very interested in machine learning and big data, and I would love to be your new data engineer.

I became interested in big data when I worked with a machine learning consultant at a previous job. He inspired me to learn Ruby, which I used to scrape websites to generate training sets for his algorithm. After this, I applied to Dev Bootcamp. 

We focused on web development at Dev Bootcamp, but I still had a chance to teach myself a couple recommendation algorithms. I built an app that recommends movies you might like, using an algorithm based on Pearson correlation. My code is hosted here: https://github.com/generalzhou/I

My experience with web development and engineering will allow me to contribute from the beginning, and my interested in data science and machine learning will allow me to contribute so much more in the months and years to come.  

Jack
