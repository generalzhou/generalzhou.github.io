<h2>Software Engineer</h2>

<p>Dev Bootcamp is a 9 week program to turn people into awesome junior developers. Over my 9 weeks, I worked about 12 hours a day (and on the weekends) and learned:</p>

<p>Ruby
Rails
JavaScript/jQuery
HTML/CSS
Rspec
HTTP/AJAX requests
databases</p>

<p>However, learning the technology was the easy part. We also:</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pair programmed all day, every day</li>
    <li>Worked on 8 group projects, using git and Github to collaborate</li>  
    <li>Performed and received code reviews</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

<p>I know the technology well enough to create relatively full featured apps. More so, I have learned to work well in a collaborative environment, teach myself new concepts and technologies, and understand, if not write, high quality code.</p>
      

<h2>Path to Dev Bootcamp</h2>

<p>Software engineer was also not the profession I went to school for. I knew I liked take apart electronics and cars and put them back together, and I ended up studying biomedical engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. I interned at Baxter and did some really cool things, including designing a novel infusion device for hemophilia patients. However, the pace of medical device engineering is on the scale of decades, way too slow for me.</p>

<p>After working for a few years in professional services, I realized I really missed engineering and puzzle solving.  I applied to Dev Bootcamp in 2012, and recently graduated this June.</p>
      
<h2>Jack Zhou</h2>

<p>Jack is not the name I was born with, nor was it my first english name. I was born in Shanghai, and my Chinese name is Zhou Chun. I moved to the US when I was 2, and my parents decided to give me an American name. My dad was really into basketball, and he loved Magic Johnson.  So they thought that my english name should be Johnson. Even in my young age, I knew that having a last name as my first name was weird.</p>
<p>The next year I started kindergarten, and on the first day we had to introduce ourselves. Over the last year, I watched a lot of movies where someone named Jack was always doing something badass (and Jack Nicholson was badass too).  I thought this was a pretty cool name, so I told my teacher and the class that I wanted to be called Jack. The teacher was shocked that someone would just decided to change their name in class, but I persisted, and after they called my parents, I started going by the name Jack Zhou.</p>
