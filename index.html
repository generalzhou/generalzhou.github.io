<h2>About Me</h2>


<p>
  Hi. I am a software engineer and recent graduate of Dev Bootcamp. I grew up in the Chicago area, and recently moved back here after going to school in St. Louis and living in Austin. I like mountain biking, cooking, learning, and going to the beach.
</p>

<h2>Dev Bootcamp</h2>

<p>Dev Bootcamp is a 9 week program to turn people into awesome junior developers. Over my 9 weeks, I worked about 12 hours a day (and on the weekends) and learned:</p>


<ul>
  <li>- Ruby</li>
  <li>- Rails</li>
  <li>- JavaScript/jQuery</li>
  <li>- HTML/CSS</li>
  <li>- Rspec</li>
  <li>- Mysql</li>
</ul>

<p>However, learning the technology was the easy part. We also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>- Pair programmed all day, every day</li>
  <li>- Worked on 8 group projects, using git and Github to collaborate</li>  
  <li>- Performed and received code reviews</li>
</ul>

<p>I developed many, many apps while learning these concepts. Here are the two that I am the most proud of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Movie recommender:</strong> This app uses a machine learning algorithm based on Pearson correlation to predict movies you might like. I used movie data from <a href="http://grouplens.org">GroupLens Research</a>.
    <br>
    Source code on <a href="https://github.com/generalzhou/movie_recommender">GitHub</a>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    <strong>StrobeHub - GitHub for music:</strong>  I worked on a four person team to build  I chose to work on this because I was excited about the challenge of building a music editor in JavaScript, a language I had little exposure to. I mostly worked on the music editor front end, learning object oriented JavaScript and the HTML5 Web Audio API along the way.

</ul>


<h2>Path to Dev Bootcamp</h2>

<p>I studied biomedical engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. I interned at Baxter and did some really cool things, including designing a novel infusion device for hemophilia patients. However, I realized that the pace of medical device engineering is on the scale of decades, which was way too slow for me.</p>

<p>After working for a few years in professional services, I realized I really missed engineering and puzzle solving.  I applied to Dev Bootcamp in 2012, and recently graduated this June.</p>
      
<h2>Jack Zhou</h2>
  
<p>Jack Zhou was not my first name. I was born in Shanghai, and my birth name is Zhou Chun. I moved to the US when I was 2, and my parents decided to give me an American name. My dad really liked basketball, and he loved Magic Johnson. So they thought that my name should be Johnson. Even in my young age, I knew that having a last name as my first name was weird.</p>
<p>The next year I started kindergarten, and on the first day we had to introduce ourselves. Over the last year, I watched a lot of movies where someone named Jack was always doing something badass (and Jack Nicholson was big back then too). I thought this was a pretty cool name, so I told my teacher and the class that I wanted to be called Jack. The teacher was shocked that someone would just decided to change their name in class, but I persisted, and after they called my parents, I started going by the name Jack Zhou.</p>
<p>If you've read this far: my picture is photoshopped.</p>
